- Include hover, focus, and active states for interactive elements
- Add smooth transitions and animations where appropriate

## Accessibility
- Use proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- Add screen reader announcements for dynamic content updates
- Include focus indicators for interactive elements
- Support reduced motion preferences
- Make the application fully accessible (WCAG compliant)

## Code Quality
